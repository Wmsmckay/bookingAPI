# bookingAPI

This API was built to handle different booking types. The language and relations in the database and application are open ended so it can be used to track any kind of event. You can even set prices for things and send invoices to people who have booked them.

I build this API with local events in mind. For example, someone who rents out a space will be able to list that space and when it is available as well as a price for its useage. Members of the community can then see that listing and book it for time. If multipe people can book/attend the event then it is kept open until it is full. After someone adds themselves to the registry they recive an invoice for the price of booking.

There are security errors in the project that I haven't addressed becuase I haven't been using or maintaining the code as it was more of a proof of concept more than a full application.
